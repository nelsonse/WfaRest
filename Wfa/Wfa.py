Wfa.py - WFA operational class
Contains the methods needed to execute WFA workflows remotely via REST protocol.

*** REQUIRES Python 2.7.x and above ***
*** IS NOT TESTED WITH Python 3.x ***
'''

class Wfa(object):
    '''
    This class provides all the required methods needed to call a generic workflow, given a small 
    amount of prior knowledge about the workflow needed to set this up.
    
    The first piece of knowledge is a username/password combination that has at least Operator privileges as defined 
    within the WFA software.  A default username/password combination is embedded currently and should be removed
    when implemented outside of a development environment as it is an invalid token.   Also the hostname that is hosting WFA
    and the full, human readable, workflow name is required.  
    
    Since WFA does not have a self describing API, and since the variables defined in the API are 
    arbitrarily named based on the whims of the creator of the workflow, both the names of the parameters and
    the intended values to be inserted into these names must be known prior to execution of the setupWorkflow and executeWorkflow
    method.  The mapping between the WFA parameter names and the values is defined by a dictionary with the following structure:
        Dictionary Key: WFA Parameter Name
        Dictionary Value: Value to pass to WFA for this parameter
        
    The two methods needed to execute workflows are: setupWorkflow and executeWorkflow.  The setupWorkflow requires the parameter map 
    listed above in order to prepare all the structures needed for execution.  The executeWorkflow takes the class variables 
    set by the setupWorkflow method and executes the workflow.
    
    Once the workflow is running, there is a method that can return a "simple" status of the job: getSimpleJobStatus.  This method returns
    either "OK", "FAILED", "DONE" or "UNKNOWN", depending on the lower level status returned by WFA.  This is structured this way to 
    prevent "over interpretation" of the intermediate status' provided by WFA - the essentially indicate that either a job is running
    ("OK"), a job is stopped prior to completion ("FAILED"), or a job completed ("DONE").  The "UNKNOWN" status is provided as a catch-all
    value.
    
    While the job is running, and at the conclusion of the job, state is maintained within a class dictionary: jobDict.  This dictionary
    stores such information as the jobId (WFA assigns this identifier), the current state of the job, the command number being executed
    and number of commands within the workflow, as well as any error codes and the values of any return parameters.
    
    In addition to providing the needed items to execute workflows, this class also provide two methods for discovering 
    the input and return structures of the workflow as defined.  These methods, printWorkflowInputList and printWorkflowOutputList
    simply require:
        1.    Instantiation of the class
        2.    Execution of a RESTful query using the getRestResponse method with the argument of the
                instance of the workflowQueryURI generated as a result of the class instantiation.  This will return raw XML
                back from the REST query
        3.    Execution of either/both methods with the raw XML resulting from item #2 above as the argument to the method
        
    The output will be the either the WFA variable name/data type/required status from WFA (in the case of InputList), or the name 
    of the return parameter (in the case of OutputList).  NOTE: The return parameter will ALWAYS be of type string.
    
    **** ENHANCEMENTS NEEDED ****
    1.    Data type handling - currently only String and Numeric types are handled.  Tables, Enum, and Boolean WFA data types are 
        currently not explicitly handled, although can be inserted if done correctly.  Enum values return a list of allowed values 
        for the input.  If the input value does not match one of the values in the list, WFA will throw a 500 HTTP error (Bad Response).
        Similarly for Boolean - it must be either 'true' or 'false' as a response.  Tables (Multi-Input) can be passed in the following 
        format (as an example 3x3 table):
        
        C1R1~C2R1~C3R1,C1R2~C2R2~C3R2,C1R3~C2R3~C3R3
        
        Data is entered as row dominant: rows are entered first, with columns separated by '~', with each individual row separated by a ','
    2.    Exception handling - there is essentially no exception handling currently.  Definite need.
    3.    Simple credentials - the urllib2 library only uses simply credentials.  Need to investigate how this operates with Keystone.
    4.    Allow for workflow UUIDs to be specified during instantiation vs. simply workflow names.
